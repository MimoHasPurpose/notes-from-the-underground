After learning a dozen of programming languages i finally decided to share all the difficulties i faced while i learned them.
problems i faced includes

- problem with grasping content
- updates in documentation
- setting up envs
- learning commands
- types of bugs
- ease of solving bugs
- ability to recall code
- flow of coding
- focus on coding

reason i am writing this article is to compare different languages
languages i would compare

1. python
2. java
3. cpp
4. LISP
5. Javascript
6. flutter
7. c
8. bash
9. go

so my criticism starts with that of c language:
one of the most important languages.
hard for students to realize the importance.
lack of good projects in c
long lines of code.
printf("") sucks
hard to type certain keys.

python

- couldn't find practice questions.
- i miss curly braces
- very slow
- scary when u wish to get a job
- professors dont promote python
-

java

- hate the syntax
- hate the ide's
- hate the community
- hard to comprehend advance level java

cpp

- hard to work with installing libraries
- requires a centralized package manager.
- lack of good web frameworks
- game libraries aren't well documented with code examples.

javascript

- hard to debug framework
- heavy code -ve influences creativity
- there is no official js docs.

flutter

- complicated code
- requires large screen to work on big projects

go

- is it really fast?
- boring documentation
- lack of framework popularity
- lack of diversity
- overhyped by google
